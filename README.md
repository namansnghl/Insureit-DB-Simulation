# Insureit - Insurance Provider Simulation

## System Description
InsureIt is a system developed to facilitate the sale of automobiles and homeowners' insurance to clients, 
all while effectively overseeing the interactions with agents and policyholders. It has the following features:
1. The system is a CLI-based application where clients can create accounts and browse through a list 
of insurances they qualify for and later purchase insurance through an agent.
2. The insurance premium is a dynamically computed value for clients, considering specific 
parameters related to the insured asset.
3. Agents have access to a private portal to view and manage their clients.
4. The internal leadership has access to an analytical dashboard view which shows the policy & agent 
performances. This view refreshes as we refresh the data on the tables. 
5. The project places greater emphasis on the efficiency of creating the system concerning data 
storage, loading, and access. 
6. In addition, we also prioritize the development of helper scripts designed to facilitate the loading 
of data feeds and the updating of analytical views
